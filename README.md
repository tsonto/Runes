# Runes
Easily work with text as Unicode codepoints. Works with the existing [`Rune`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.rune?view=net-5.0) type, which represents a Unicode codepoint.

## RuneString
Like `string`, but for `Rune`s instead of `char`s. Provides many of the same methods that you expect from `string`, plus several encoding methods.

## RuneStone
Provides extension methods for working with `string`s, Unicode character categories, and the like.
